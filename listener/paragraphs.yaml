  Currently, ZenoBot is a service that watches cryptos and notifies users when CUSUM filter events occur.
  This is best articulated by an example. Let's say you have 'BTC/USDT tick_100_10' in your watchlist. ZenoBot
  will watch the BTC/USDT transactions in real-time and record a price every 100 ticks. When it records a new
  price, it finds the percentage difference between it and the previously recorded price, adding the modulus (so 
  a change of -0.45% would INCREASE the sum by 0.45) of this value to a Cumulative Sum count. Once the Cumulative
  Sum count adds up to your filter level of 10%, it will notify you.

description_1:
>
  For brevity: A notification is sent when the cumulative percentage change between adjacent
  100-tick-aggregated BTC/USDT prices exceeds 10%. So what's the point? Prices are not impacted by time. They are
  impacted by stores of wealth exchanging hands (market events). As a result, you'd rather know when market events
  are occurring than just checking the charts every x minutes. The CUSUM filter therefore sends many more notifications
  in periods of high volatility than it does in low ones, so you know when to pay attention. Available aggregations
  are tick (trade number), dollar (dollars exchanged) and volume (coins exchanged) Enter /future to learn more about
  future developments.

  More Sources - Currently, we're only watching FTX, but have plans to incorporate Binance, Kraken and Coinbase
  AI - We're building a system to predict price movements based on event-aggregated prices. These predictions are
  communicated when the CUSUM filter hits.
  Price Levels - A store of important Price levels (Fibb.) so at each event-trigger we have some context for where
  a price is headed.
  Indicator Check - checks a range of financial indicators and automatically relays results
  Trade calculator - uses a recent volatility measurement to suggest a potential trade setup including TP/SL/TL
